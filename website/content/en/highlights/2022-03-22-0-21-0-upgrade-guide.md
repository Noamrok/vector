## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### GraphQL API `outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns` subscription argument `patterns` changed to `outputsPatterns` {#api-patterns-to-outputspatterns}

To avoid confusion and align with the new `inputsPatterns` argument, we've
renamed the original `patterns` argument to `outputsPatterns`. `outputsPatterns`
allows you to specify patterns that will match against components (sources,
transforms) and display their _outflowing_ events. `inputsPatterns` allows you
to specify patterns that match against components (transforms, sinks) and
display their _incoming_ events.

Note that using an input pattern to match a component is effectively a
shorthand. It's the same as using one or more output patterns to match against
all the outputs flowing into a component.

Updating your subscriptions is as simple as renaming `patterns` to
`outputsPatterns`.

```diff
- subscription {
-  outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns(patterns: [...])
+ subscription {
+  outputEventsByComponentIdPatterns(outputsPatterns: [...])
```
